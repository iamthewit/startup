# Startup Script

Simple script to run some applications when your computer boots based on whether it's a weekday or the weekend.

## Installation
Copy the 'workday.cfg.example' and 'weekend.cfg.example' files and remove the '.example extension'.

On each line enter the name of the application you want to launch.

Run the script when your computer boots. 

On Ubuntu this can be done by opening 'Startup Applications Preferences' (see the screenshots for more info).
